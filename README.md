# Rafael "Pael" Gutierrez

Hi! I'm Pael (he/him). I'm a geodetic engineer who fell in love with coding after a janky Dota CLI script, and I've been a software engineer for a few years now. I had success channeling my laziness into making tools that make those painful, manual work go away.

Outside of code: 
- I'm a professional singer
- I like playing games. I mainly play League (ADC), and Dota 2 (Pos 1)
- I like homelabbing and self-hosting random stuff
